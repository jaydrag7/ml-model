This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether clients of a Portuguese banking institution will subscribe to a term deposit, utilizing data from direct marketing campaigns involving phone calls.

**Techniques and Tools Utilized:**

- **Data Analysis:** Leveraged pandas for data manipulation and exploration, allowing for in-depth analysis of the dataset.
  
- **Feature Selection:** Employed data science techniques to select the most relevant features, ensuring the model's effectiveness and efficiency.
  
- **Model Training:** Utilized scikit-learn to encode categorical variables and train various machine learning models on the dataset.
  
**Machine Learning Models Used:**

1. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):** Employed a neural network architecture capable of learning complex patterns in the data.
  
2. **Logistic Regression:** Utilized for binary classification, providing insights into the likelihood of term deposit subscription based on predictor variables.
  
3. **Gaussian Classifier:** Employed for probabilistic classification, modeling the likelihood of class membership based on Gaussian distributions.
  
4. **Hist Gradient Boosting:** Utilized a gradient boosting algorithm capable of handling large datasets and yielding high predictive accuracy.
  
5. **Random Forest Classifier:** Employed an ensemble learning technique to aggregate predictions from multiple decision trees, offering robustness and generalization capability.
  
6. **Sequential Layer Neural Network:** Implemented a deep learning architecture with sequential layers, enabling the model to capture intricate relationships within the data.

By leveraging these techniques and tools, the project aimed to develop a robust predictive model capable of assisting the banking institution in optimizing its marketing campaigns and improving subscription rates for term deposits.
